The Ergodox has 3\nqualities that make it a keyboard unique: it’s physically separated into two\nhalves, it adds new keys to form two distinct thumb clusters (similar to the\n<a href=\"http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Kinesis</a>), and its\ndesign is fully open source. All of these qualities combine to form a keyboard\nthat is great for someone who regularly sits in front of a computer long enough\nto figure out how to actually build one — it’s ergonomically sound and every\nkey is reprogrammable. I ordered one off of\n<a href=\"https://www.massdrop.com/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Massdrop</a>; here’s how I built it:</p>\n<p>The components arrived in a box unassembled and cushioned by bubble wrap. I\nopted for the cherry MX blue switches and the extended palm rest for this\nbuild. Although I would have preferred brown switches, supply issues made is so\nthat those weren’t an option in the particular drop I participated in and I\nwasn’t in the mood to source switched myself. Besides, if I was going to\nassemble the keyboard anyways, I figured I could always unassembled it later\n(or just buy a new one).</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7gGV__dd9IY/U1782TM65lI/AAAAAAAAAVY/8IY4pPeEAOE/s1600/IMG_20140225_193902.jpg\" height=\"320\" width=\"240\"></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y3eCchocE3A/U1786Gqxj_I/AAAAAAAAAVg/VmYW5qXoAmc/s1600/IMG_20140225_194000.jpg\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\"></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--P0TUjesEy0/U1786czSrxI/AAAAAAAAAVo/4ELRN29VtJM/s1600/IMG_20140227_215522.jpg\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\"></p>\n<p>Because the build was going to require a good amount of soldering, I opted to\nsplurge a little bit on a decent soldering iron. I picked up a Weller WES51with\nadjustable temperature for around $80 on Amazon and a generic solder sucker for\nthe occasional screwup. Because this build requires soldering surface mount\ndiodes, I highly recommend using a quality rig and if you can get a fine solder\ntip, that’s even better.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-koxGLpIjPFk/U1787Ru2O6I/AAAAAAAAAV4/5OxWYNbfu28/s1600/IMG_20140428_171950.jpg\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\"></p>\n<p>The build began by soldering on a few resistors, headers, the headphone TRRS\njacks, and the Teensey micro-controller that serves as the brains of the\nkeyboard. The Ergodox PCB is designed such that both halves are actually copies\nof the same PCB so one arbitrary choice later, I was happily on my way to a\nsemi-populated board. The kit contained two mini-B cables, one for connecting\nthe keyboard to the computer, and another for connecting the Teensy\nmicro-controller to the PCB. In order to accomplish the second task, the cable\nhad to be cannibalized so the connector would fit into the casing. Doing so\nproved to be the most difficult (and dangerous) part of the entire build. I\nopted to slowly whittle away at the insulation with a sharp knife, however, I\nhave heard that a Dremel is the most effective method.</p>\n<p>!(<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-koxGLpIjPFk/U1787Ru2O6I/AAAAAAAAAV4/5OxWYNbfu28/s1600/IMG_20140428_171950.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-koxGLpIjPFk/U1787Ru2O6I/AAAAAAAAAV4/5OxWYNbfu28/s1600/IMG_20140428_171950.jpg</a>)</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5rSK1lHs0HY/U1786biMsUI/AAAAAAAAAVk/dllqd4LC7bc/s1600/IMG_20140301_152137.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\"></p>\n<p>The next part is probably the part most people have trouble with. The plans\ncall for surface mount diodes to be painfully soldered next to each switch on\nthe PCB. Needle tweezers are a must in this situation and I found it easiest to\nplace a small dab of solder on one of the pads, then hold the diode over the\npad while re-melting the solder and moving the diode into the proper position.\nSolder flux would have been very helpful in this situation however, I did not\nhave any on hand so I opted to charge ahead without it. During this step, it’s\nabsolutely important to ensure that each diode is <strong>facing the proper\ndirection</strong> . Failing to do so will render the keyboard inoperable and you will\nhave to go back and correct each incorrect diode. For this build, the tiny grey\nstipe on the diode should be facing the square pad.</p>\n<p>The next step is to begin mounting each switch onto acrylic frame. Because the\nswitches included in this kit are of the plate mounted kinda, as opposed to the\nPCB mounted types, this step must be done before soldering them on the board.\nThis also means that if you want to change the case, you will have to desolder\nevery switch in order to fully liberate the PCB.

The Ergodox has 3\nqualities that make it a keyboard unique: it’s physically separated into two\nhalves, it adds new keys to form two distinct thumb clusters (similar to the\n[Kinesis](http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/)), and its\ndesign is fully open source. All of these qualities combine to form a keyboard\nthat is great for someone who regularly sits in front of a computer long enough\nto figure out how to actually build one -- it’s ergonomically sound and every\nkey is reprogrammable. I ordered one off of\n[Massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/home); here’s how I built it:\n\n\nThe components arrived in a box unassembled and cushioned by bubble wrap. I\nopted for the cherry MX blue switches and the extended palm rest for this\nbuild. Although I would have preferred brown switches, supply issues made is so\nthat those weren't an option in the particular drop I participated in and I\nwasn't in the mood to source switched myself. Besides, if I was going to\nassemble the keyboard anyways, I figured I could always unassembled it later\n(or just buy a new one).\n\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7gGV__dd9IY/U1782TM65lI/AAAAAAAAAVY/8IY4pPeEAOE/s1600/IMG_20140225_193902.jpg\" height=\"320\" width=\"240\">\n\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y3eCchocE3A/U1786Gqxj_I/AAAAAAAAAVg/VmYW5qXoAmc/s1600/IMG_20140225_194000.jpg\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\">\n\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--P0TUjesEy0/U1786czSrxI/AAAAAAAAAVo/4ELRN29VtJM/s1600/IMG_20140227_215522.jpg\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\">\n\nBecause the build was going to require a good amount of soldering, I opted to\nsplurge a little bit on a decent soldering iron. I picked up a Weller WES51with\nadjustable temperature for around $80 on Amazon and a generic solder sucker for\nthe occasional screwup. Because this build requires soldering surface mount\ndiodes, I highly recommend using a quality rig and if you can get a fine solder\ntip, that's even better.\n\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-koxGLpIjPFk/U1787Ru2O6I/AAAAAAAAAV4/5OxWYNbfu28/s1600/IMG_20140428_171950.jpg\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\">\n\n\nThe build began by soldering on a few resistors, headers, the headphone TRRS\njacks, and the Teensey micro-controller that serves as the brains of the\nkeyboard. The Ergodox PCB is designed such that both halves are actually copies\nof the same PCB so one arbitrary choice later, I was happily on my way to a\nsemi-populated board. The kit contained two mini-B cables, one for connecting\nthe keyboard to the computer, and another for connecting the Teensy\nmicro-controller to the PCB. In order to accomplish the second task, the cable\nhad to be cannibalized so the connector would fit into the casing. Doing so\nproved to be the most difficult (and dangerous) part of the entire build. I\nopted to slowly whittle away at the insulation with a sharp knife, however, I\nhave heard that a Dremel is the most effective method.\n\n!(http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-koxGLpIjPFk/U1787Ru2O6I/AAAAAAAAAV4/5OxWYNbfu28/s1600/IMG_20140428_171950.jpg)\n\n\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5rSK1lHs0HY/U1786biMsUI/AAAAAAAAAVk/dllqd4LC7bc/s1600/IMG_20140301_152137.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\">\n\n\nThe next part is probably the part most people have trouble with. The plans\ncall for surface mount diodes to be painfully soldered next to each switch on\nthe PCB. Needle tweezers are a must in this situation and I found it easiest to\nplace a small dab of solder on one of the pads, then hold the diode over the\npad while re-melting the solder and moving the diode into the proper position.\nSolder flux would have been very helpful in this situation however, I did not\nhave any on hand so I opted to charge ahead without it. During this step, it's\nabsolutely important to ensure that each diode is **facing the proper\ndirection** . Failing to do so will render the keyboard inoperable and you will\nhave to go back and correct each incorrect diode. For this build, the tiny grey\nstipe on the diode should be facing the square pad.\n\n\nThe next step is to begin mounting each switch onto acrylic frame. Because the\nswitches included in this kit are of the plate mounted kinda, as opposed to the\nPCB mounted types, this step must be done before soldering them on the board.\nThis also means that if you want to change the case, you will have to desolder\nevery switch in order to fully liberate the PCB. These plate mounted switches\ntend to be more durable than the alternatives, so that's a win for stability,\nstill, it makes me sad that once you continue past this step, you're locked\ninto using the original acrylic case.\n\n\nI found it best to mount and solder each of the corner switches first before\nfilling in the middle.

Furthermore, these browsers will also restrict buffering multiple audio tracks making seamless audio switching difficult at best. While these restrictions are fine for most applications, some apps require many sounds to be played in quick succession. Games with sound effects are the biggest victim of this policy and the most commonly used strategy to circumvent it is to use <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/04/html5-audio-and-audio-sprites-this-should-be-simple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">audio sprites</a>.

The Web Audio API is based on the concept of nodes which allow you to channel data through various transformation functions before finally outputting it. For the sake of this tutorial, all we care about is playback so all we need to do is connect one of the buffers to the output device. We do that using the <strong>connect()</strong>  method:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">songData[<span class=\"number\">0</span>].connect(myAudioContext.destination);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>Although we can start playing the audio now, it is not ideal to do so because audio buffers cannot be restarted.

Furthermore, these browsers will also restrict buffering multiple audio tracks making seamless audio switching difficult at best. While these restrictions are fine for most applications, some apps require many sounds to be played in quick succession. Games with sound effects are the biggest victim of this policy and the most commonly used strategy to circumvent it is to use [audio sprites](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/04/html5-audio-and-audio-sprites-this-should-be-simple/). Below, I will discuss an alternate method that makes use of XMLHttpRequests and the experimental Web Audio API to buffer audio files in parallel then seamless switch between them.\n\n\n### Solution\nThe first thing we need to do is setup our Web Audio API context. Because the spec has yet to be finalized, it may be necessary to use a vendor prefix:\n\n```javascript\nif ('webkitAudioContext' in window) {\n  var myAudioContext = new webkitAudioContext();\n} else {\n  var myAudioContext = new AudioContext();\n}\n```\n\nHere, we simple check to see if the prefixed version exists, if not we use the non prefixed version.\n\n\nThe XMLHttpRequest object has received some major updates in the last few years. In addition to being able to send and receive text, it can now do the same with [arraybuffers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ArrayBuffer), [blobs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob), and documents. Using the wonderful [Async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async) library, we simultaneously download multiple audio files as arraybuffers and save them for playback later:\n\n```javascript\nvar songUrls = [ /* list of song URLs to buffer */ ];\nvar songData = [];\nasync.map(songUrls, function (url, cb) {\n  request = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  request.open('GET', url, true);\n  request.responseType = 'arraybuffer';\n  request.addEventListener('load', function (event) {\n    try {\n      var request = event.target;\n      var source = myAudioContext.createBufferSource();\n      source.buffer = myAudioContext.createBuffer(request.response, false);\n      return cb(null, source);\n    } catch (err) {\n      return cb(err);\n    }\n  }, false);\n  request.send();\n}, function (err, result) {\n  if (err) {\n    $('#message').text(\"Error Buffering: \" + err);\n    return;\n  }\n  songData = result;\n});\n```\n\nYou'll notice that once the array buffer is finished downloading we immediately create a new [AudioBufferSourceNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBufferSourceNode) and populate it with the downloaded data using the createBuffer method (bonus: the preferred way to do this step is to use the [decodeAudioData()](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/apis/webaudio/AudioContext/decodeAudioData) method because it's asynchronous and has better error handling).\n  \n  \nAt this point, we now have an array of audio buffers so let's look at how to play them back. The Web Audio API is based on the concept of nodes which allow you to channel data through various transformation functions before finally outputting it. For the sake of this tutorial, all we care about is playback so all we need to do is connect one of the buffers to the output device. We do that using the **connect()**  method:\n\n```javascript\nsongData[0].connect(myAudioContext.destination);\n```\n\nAlthough we can start playing the audio now, it is not ideal to do so because audio buffers cannot be restarted. To get around this, we first clone the audio buffer we want to playback:\n\n```javascript\nsource = myAudioContext.createBufferSource(); source.buffer = songData[0].buffer; source.connect(myAudioContext.destination); source.start(0);\n```\n\nNow, if we want to restart the track or switch to a new track, we can do so by calling **source.stop(0)**  then clone the next audio buffer and start playing it.\n\n\nA working implementation of this method can be found at  [http://emgeee.com/projects/web\\_audio\\_test](http://emgeee.com/projects/web_audio_test)\n\n\n### Limitations\n\nWhile the method described overcome some of the limitations imposed by mobile browsers, it is still constrained by the need for some sort of user interaction before the audio can start playing. On the bright side, we can at least buffer the audio before hand so that when the user does hit play, the audio will start immediately. Normal HTML5 <audio> elements on mobile aren't allowed to buffer until after the user hits play.\n\n\nUnlike the <audio> element, this method is also limited by XSS policies imposed by the browser. This means you will only be able to use it to stream media from the same domain or from a server that has CORS enabled.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis post describes a method for buffering audio in parallel and playing it back using the experimental Web Audio API.  I expect this method will become more robust in the future as the API is further standardized across browsers.

To begin with, JFK is a terrible airport. I mean seriously, no free wifi? Also no Starbucks past the security line means I had to get my caffeine fix from something in a can. Also don't fly China Eastern. The seats were far too small and the inflight entertainment was atrocious (read: non existent). It was also a weird experience seeing people milling around in the aisles mid flight chatting in Chinese across the width of the plane. I don't feel like this behavior would have gone over too well on an American airline... oh well.\n\nAfter an hour long delay in Shanghai and a flight that seemed to go on forever (you know the ones where you swear you're almost there only to realize you're 2 hours into a 4 hour flight), my friend and I touched down in Bangkok at around 4am in the morning. For whatever reason customs was the part that I was most worried about because I had absolutely no idea what to expect. Turns out expecting nothing would have been the right choice as a stamp and a smile later I was through to baggage claim.\n\nTaxis in Thailand are a peculiar thing, or at least completely different than in America.
