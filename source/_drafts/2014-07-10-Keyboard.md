title: The Mechanical Keyboard

---

Early in my college career I became the proud owner of Das Keyboard. At the
time, the mechanical keyboard movement was very much in its infancy (if you
could call it a movement at all) and the only ones that were easily available
came with either blue switches for loud and satisfying “click clack” or the
quitter brown keys, which were excellent at not pissing off your co-workers. I
had originally heard about the keyboards some years before when the blank
version was sold on Thinkgeek as what seemed like a novelty item but I learned
later it was actually a legitimate product that made some interesting promises.
Aside from making you computer inaccessible to your non-touch typing friends,
the mechanical cherry switches used were rated for 10 million key presses. I’ve
never been one to treat my tools poorly but the thought of having a keyboard
that could conceivably last me a generation was enticing. Along with the
durability, the cherry blue switches promised faster typing speeds. While it
would take me another few years to realize that I had been typing incorrectly
my entire life and that that is really what was slowing me down, when that
keyboard finally arrived, I could not have been more excited.
